This is a basic Javascript code where a deck of standard cards is created, shuffled, and then dealt to the number of players based on a user input.

<h3>Assumptions made:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>HTML/CSS not required, and the the functionality is the main aspect being looked into.</li>
  <li>The number of players is equal to the number of cards (which is at least 1, but not more than 52)</li>
  <li>Since this is a plain Javascript code, the prompt() functionality could not be used, and the user is requested to input the number and run the code. </li></ol>
