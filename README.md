This is a basic Javascript code where a deck of standard cards is created, shuffled, and then dealt to the number of players based on a user input.

<h3>Assumptions made:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>HTML/CSS not required, and the the functionality is the main aspect being looked into.</li>
  <li>The number of players is not restricted, and hence when the user presents the input for the number of players, the cards are dealt accordingly. For example, if the user inputs 8 as the number of people, 4 players get 7 cards each while the remaining 4 will get 6 cards. the distribution is equal according to this.</li>
  <li>Since this is a plain Javascript code, the prompt() functionality could not be used, and the user is requested to input the number and run the code. To run a value of 8, for example, we would request the user to please add the number in the line 63 (var noOfPlayers = 8). </li></ol>
